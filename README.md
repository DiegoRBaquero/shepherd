# shepherd2
A utility for applying code changes across many repositories

### Developing

Run `npm install` to install dependencies, and the `npm install -g` to make the `shepherd` executable available on your `PATH`.

We use Babel to enable modern ES syntax like async/await. When developing shepherd2, it's recommended to run `npm run build:watch` in a separate terminal. This will constantly recompile the source code as you edit it.
